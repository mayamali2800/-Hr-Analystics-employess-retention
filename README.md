 # Problem Statement:
- Average attrition rate for all Departments
- Average hourly rate of Male Research Scientist

### Insights for KPI 1
We can clearly say that attrition rate of employees for every department is almost 50% which indicates that attrition rate of employees does not depends on department. So, irrespective of the department almost 50% of employees are leaving the company.
From this calculation and visualization we concluded that we must make strong strategies to minimize attrition rate and improve our company’s Employee retention so that we can balance the company’s growth and right talent.
